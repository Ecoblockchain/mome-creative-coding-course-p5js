# MOME Creative Coding Course using p5js (Spring 2015)

A growing collection of examples used to demonstarte basic concepts of creative coding.

The course site can be found at http://stc.mome.hu/blog/index.php?id=vizualis-programnyelvek-1 (hungarian). Most examples are based on problems we have covered during the course. A few examples are ported from processing tutorials and some are modified versions of the excellent js repository at ITP New York: https://github.com/lmccart/itp-creative-js  

The ios-touch-example folder is an example on how to prepare your sketches to be published on an iOS device, as a webapp. It is using touch events and is adjusted to fit the device conditions (avoids scrolling). To publish it onto your device, navigate to the index.html by [launching a local webserver](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server), or upload it to a working server ( such as [this example](http://www.binaura.net/stc/tmp/mome/vizprog2015/ios-touch-example/) that works only with touch devices). When the url is opened in mobile safari, select "Add to Homescreen". This will add an icon to your homescreen, with customizable icon, splash screen, etc. More detailed info on webapps can be found [here](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/optimizing-mobile-web-apps-ios).

#Sources

Some diagram related sources that we covered during the course. The origins of creating visual programs can be found in the concepts of descriptive and prescriptive diagrams. When manipulation meets representation, interaction happens.
